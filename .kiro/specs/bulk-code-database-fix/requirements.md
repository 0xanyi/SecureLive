# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The bulk access codes feature is experiencing database errors during authentication, specifically "BULK_CODE_DATABASE_ERROR - Database error during authentication". This indicates that the required database functions for bulk code operations may be missing or incorrectly configured. This spec addresses the need to diagnose and fix the database layer issues preventing successful bulk code authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to diagnose the current database state for bulk code functions, so that I can identify what's missing or misconfigured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking the database THEN the system SHALL verify the existence of all required bulk code functions
2. WHEN checking the database THEN the system SHALL validate that the access_codes table has the required columns for bulk codes
3. WHEN checking the database THEN the system SHALL confirm that function permissions are properly set
4. WHEN checking the database THEN the system SHALL identify any missing indexes or constraints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to apply missing database migrations, so that all required functions and schema changes are properly deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying database fixes THEN the system SHALL create any missing database functions
2. WHEN applying database fixes THEN the system SHALL add any missing table columns or constraints
3. WHEN applying database fixes THEN the system SHALL set proper function permissions for authenticated and service roles
4. WHEN applying database fixes THEN the system SHALL validate that all changes are applied successfully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want bulk code authentication to work without database errors, so that I can successfully log in using bulk access codes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to authenticate with a bulk code THEN the system SHALL successfully call database functions without errors
2. WHEN a user authenticates with a bulk code THEN the system SHALL properly check capacity using optimized functions
3. WHEN a user authenticates with a bulk code THEN the system SHALL increment usage counters without database errors
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear, user-friendly error messages instead of database errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify the database fix is working, so that I can confirm bulk code authentication is functioning properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the fix THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate users with valid bulk codes
2. WHEN testing the fix THEN the system SHALL properly reject users when capacity is exceeded
3. WHEN testing the fix THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access attempts without database errors
4. WHEN testing the fix THEN the system SHALL maintain accurate usage counters across multiple authentication attempts
