# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables administrators to create a single access code that can be used by multiple users (up to 400) to gain access to the system. The code has a limited validity period of one day and tracks usage to prevent exceeding the maximum capacity. This addresses the challenge of managing large-scale events where distributing individual codes to hundreds of participants would be impractical.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create a bulk access code with a specified capacity limit, so that I can efficiently manage access for large events without creating individual codes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a bulk access code THEN the system SHALL allow setting a maximum usage limit between 1 and 400 users
2. WHEN creating a bulk access code THEN the system SHALL automatically set the expiration to 24 hours from creation time
3. WHEN a bulk access code is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique, secure code identifier
4. WHEN a bulk access code is created THEN the system SHALL initialize the usage counter to zero

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use a bulk access code to gain system access, so that I can participate in events without needing an individual code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid bulk access code THEN the system SHALL grant access if the usage limit has not been exceeded
2. WHEN a user enters a bulk access code THEN the system SHALL increment the usage counter by one
3. WHEN a user enters an expired bulk access code THEN the system SHALL reject the access attempt with an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user enters a bulk access code that has reached its usage limit THEN the system SHALL reject the access attempt with a "capacity exceeded" message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor bulk access code usage, so that I can track event attendance and manage capacity effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing bulk access codes THEN the system SHALL display current usage count versus maximum capacity
2. WHEN viewing bulk access codes THEN the system SHALL show remaining time until expiration
3. WHEN a bulk access code reaches 80% capacity THEN the system SHALL provide a visual warning indicator
4. WHEN a bulk access code expires or reaches full capacity THEN the system SHALL mark it as inactive

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage bulk access codes lifecycle, so that I can maintain system security and prevent unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bulk access code expires THEN the system SHALL automatically deactivate it and prevent further usage
2. WHEN an administrator manually deactivates a bulk access code THEN the system SHALL immediately prevent further usage
3. WHEN viewing expired bulk access codes THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate their inactive status
4. IF a bulk access code is deactivated THEN the system SHALL maintain historical usage data for reporting purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to integrate bulk access codes with the existing event system, so that access is properly tied to specific events and sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a bulk access code THEN the system SHALL allow associating it with a specific event
2. WHEN a user accesses via bulk code THEN the system SHALL automatically register them for the associated event
3. WHEN viewing event analytics THEN the system SHALL include users who accessed via bulk codes in attendance metrics
4. WHEN an event ends THEN the system SHALL automatically deactivate associated bulk access codes
