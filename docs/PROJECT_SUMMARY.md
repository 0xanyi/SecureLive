# STPPL UK and Europe - Event Streaming Platform
## Project Summary & Next Steps

### 📅 Event Information
- **Event**: STPPL UK and Europe
- **Dates**: August 14-17, 2025 (Thursday - Sunday)
- **Type**: Live streaming event with code-based authentication

### 🎯 Project Overview
A modern, lightweight streaming platform that allows attendees to access live video content using unique access codes. The system differentiates between center codes (single location use) and individual codes (multiple concurrent sessions), with comprehensive attendance tracking and admin management capabilities.

### 🛠 Technology Stack

#### Frontend & Backend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Email**: Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)
- **Video**: Flow Player (embed integration)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

#### Key Libraries
- React Hook Form + Zod (forms & validation)
- TanStack Query (data fetching)
- Recharts (analytics visualization)
- Lucide React (icons)
- date-fns (date manipulation)

### 🚀 Ready to Implement

The platform is fully planned and ready for development. Here's what we'll build:

#### Core Features
1. **Public Access**
   - Simple code entry interface
   - Secure session management
   - Live video streaming
   - Event schedule display

2. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Code generation (bulk & individual)
   - Concurrent session configuration
   - Email notifications via Brevo
   - Real-time attendance tracking
   - Analytics and reporting
   - Export capabilities

3. **Security & Performance**
   - Row-level security in Supabase
   - Session token encryption
   - Rate limiting
   - CDN optimization
   - Mobile-responsive design

### 📊 Key Differentiators

| Feature | Center Codes | Individual Codes |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Concurrent Sessions | 1 only | Configurable (1-n) |
| Use Case | Physical locations | Personal access |
| Tracking | Location-based | Device-based |
| Email Notifications | Bulk send | Individual send |

### 🔄 Session Management Flow

```
User Entry → Code Validation → Session Check → Stream Access
                ↓                    ↓              ↓
            Invalid Code    Limit Reached    Track Attendance
                ↓                    ↓              ↓
            Show Error        Block Access    Log Analytics
```

### 📈 Development Timeline

| Week | Focus Area | Deliverables |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | Foundation | Project setup, Supabase integration, database schema |
| 2 | Core Features | Authentication system, session management |
| 3 | Admin & Stream | Dashboard, video integration, email setup |
| 4 | Polish & Deploy | Testing, optimization, production deployment |
