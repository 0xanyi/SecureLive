# Events Feature Setup Instructions

## Database Setup

1. **Update Database Schema**

   - The events table and functions have been added to `supabase-schema.sql`
   - If you haven't set up the database yet, run the entire `supabase-schema.sql` file
   - If you already have the database set up, you can run just the events section (from line with "Events table for live streaming sessions" to the end)

2. **Alternative: Run Events Schema Only**
   - Use the separate `events-schema.sql` file if you prefer to add just the events functionality

## Features Added

### Admin Dashboard

- **Events Management**: New "Events" section in admin sidebar
- **Create/Edit Events**: Full CRUD operations for events
- **Event Status**: Live, upcoming, past, and inactive event tracking
- **Event Duration**: Real-time progress tracking and time remaining

### Login Page
